# Toy Project

This repository contains the source code for a toy project aimed at demonstrating key concepts in software development, including file management, Wi-Fi initialization, HTTP requests, and JSON parsing using the ESP32 platform.

## Features

- **ESP32 Wi-Fi Management**: Code for initializing and managing Wi-Fi connections on an ESP32 device.
- **SD Card File Management**: Handling of file operations on an SD card connected to the ESP32.
- **HTTP POST Requests**: Sending HTTP POST requests with customizable request bodies and handling responses.
- **JSON Parsing**: Parsing JSON data received from HTTP responses for further processing.
- **Audio File Management**: Downloading and managing audio files with metadata in `.cubbies` format.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**:
  - ESP32 WROVER-E module
  - SD Card
  - Internet connection for the ESP32
  
- **Software**:
  - Espressif IDF (ESP-IDF) framework
  - Espressif ADF (ESP-ADF) framework
  - Visual Studio Code (with ESP-IDF extension)
  - Git for version control

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raviipandey/Toy.git
   cd Toy
   ```

2. **Set Up ESP-IDF and ESP-ADF**:
   - Follow the [ESP-IDF setup guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) to install the necessary tools and frameworks.
   - Ensure that the ESP-ADF is also installed if audio features are required.

3. **Configure the Project**:
   - Copy `example_config.h` to `config.h` and update it with your specific configuration details, such as Wi-Fi credentials and server URLs.
   - Modify any other configuration files as needed for your specific setup.

4. **Build and Flash the Code**:
   ```bash
   idf.py set-target esp32
   idf.py menuconfig
   idf.py build
   idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   - Once the code is flashed to your ESP32 device, it will start executing, and you can monitor the output via the serial monitor.

## Project Structure

- **main/**: Contains the core application code, including Wi-Fi initialization, file management, and HTTP request handling.
- **components/**: Custom components or libraries used in the project.
- **sdkconfig**: Configuration file generated by `idf.py menuconfig`.
- **Makefile**: Makefile for building the project.
- **CMakeLists.txt**: CMake configuration files.
